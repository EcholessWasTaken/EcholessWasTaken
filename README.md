Hi! I am Echoless, an Albertan game developer that loves learning new things!
You can reach me by using Discord, and joining my server: https://discord.gg/dk4R4Mf8Xw
Which is quite new, so do feel free do join as we have a lovely community with QOTD, and
many other bots to use! We have an active and friendly staff, self roles, and more!
I love to make games, as you could tell, but I am quite lazy so I make my projects
in Scratch and convert them to browser games using HTMLifier, which is an awesome tool
by the way! I hope you enjoy my little projects, and if you have any suggestions or bug
reports, let us know in our discord server!
